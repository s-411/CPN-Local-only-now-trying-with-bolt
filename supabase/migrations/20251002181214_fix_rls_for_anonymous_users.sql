  # Fix RLS Policies for Anonymous Session-Based Users

  This migration removes auth.uid() based policies and creates policies
  that work with anonymous users using session tokens.

  Security: API layer validates session tokens and sets user_id correctly.
  RLS ensures users can only access their own data via user_id filtering.
